# Project Cleanup Summary

## Files Removed (Redundant/Old):

- `myshell.exe` (old version, replaced with updated version)
- `myshell_new.exe` (intermediate build)
- `swapshell.exe` (old name)
- `test_input.txt` (temporary test file)
- `test_commands.bat` (redundant test script)

## Files Kept (Essential):

- `myshell.cpp` - Main source code
- `myshell.exe` - Current working executable (renamed from myshell_updated.exe)
- `build.bat` - Updated build script with cleanup
- `README.md` - Documentation
- `test_*.txt` - Essential test command files
- `web/` - Web version directory
- Other build/deploy files

## Improvements Made:

1. Removed redundant executables
2. Cleaned up temporary test files
3. Updated build.bat to clean old executables before rebuilding
4. Renamed final executable to standard name
5. Maintained clean project structure

Project is now clean and organized with only essential files.
